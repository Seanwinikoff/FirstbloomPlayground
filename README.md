# FirstbloomPlayground

For this project, I had the opportunity to dive into production data from Firstbloom-- a coffee centered consumer tech company. Within this database I mainly focused on the coffee tasting notes and how this may, or may not have, affected consumer purchasing trends. I was fortunate enough to host and manage this database locally on my computer. This allowed me to have hands-on experience with manipulating real-life consumer data. 
This was all done in PostgreSQL.

Included: SQL Scripts
